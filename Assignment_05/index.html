<h1> Harry Potter <h1>
<h2> J.K. Rowling </h2>
<hr />
<p> Harry Potter is a 7 book series that came out the year I was born.
The series follows the lives of a young wizard and his friends as they navigate challenges in the wizarding world.</p>
<p> This series was magical to read because the charachters grew up as I did. My mom read all of the books out loud to my siblings and I.
We all loved the books and movies. I remember staying up late and going to different book release parties and then staying up as late as I could to read the book after the party. </p>
<p> Harry Potter is a series loved by many and remains a comoforting read for me. </p>
