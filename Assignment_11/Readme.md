1. System fonts are native to a device - they are already installed within your local system. Web fonts are hosted on a server and are custom fonts that are designed to perform on the web, but are not fool proof since people use different browsers and systems. Web safe fonts have been designed with the consideration for the web and to be available to most systems. They are standardized.
2. Fallback fonts are important to have in case the font you intended to be used is not a web-safe font or a system font. If the server needs to replace the font it will use the fallback. The font stack is the order in which the system will try to replace the font.
3. Creating the pseudo-element was tricky for me this week. I could not get it to register at first but realized it was a silly mistake - the default color i had chosen barely registered as visually different since i adjusted the color subtly before changing the font size. Upon closer inspection I saw that it was working though it took me a silly amount of time to realize it. Next time I will make sure to increase the size and then add the color tag.
