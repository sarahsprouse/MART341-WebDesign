1. The universal selector type styles every element on a page compared to the element selector which is applied to select elements of a specific type. The class selector lets you select elements that serve the same function and the id selector lets you define style rules for a specific unique element.
2. For my site color palette, I was inspired by the wallpaper image I found. I like the contrasting pinks and oranges and the warm hues the image gave. I associate warm tones with the 60s. I chose orange, dark magenta, and sienna. Though magenta was not initially in the wallpaper image I found I thought it tied in the fashion image. I kept the text black to compliment the sienna and warm tones.
3. Getting my images to be centered was a challenge for me this week. I was able to align the bottom two images pretty easily, but my header kept going out of the container. Through process and play I was able to resize the container and image so that it was displaying with balance.
