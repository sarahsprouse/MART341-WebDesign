A main document can only have one head element and one body element.
They differ in the type of information they offer. The head shares information about the page - it is the "thoughts of the page" and the body shares further descriptive information - it is the "meats and potatoes."
Structural markup is used to distinguish information structures within the page. Semantic markup is used to distinguish visually or emphasize, certain words and phrases. It can also be used to add quotations.
