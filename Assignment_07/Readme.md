I come across forms every day. Email subscription is widely popular and is solicited the most in my experience. These forms allow companies and organization to gather information about you. If a company has access to your email then they have direct access to you and are more likely to keep your attention.  

I like that there are different options for text within forms - such as with the text area or general text information. Text area allows you to provide a larger text space and brief description of the text area's intended use. Selection input allows for more control over the type of data gathered. It allows for a more narrow type of data entry and selection by narrowing the end users choices. Buttons serve both as a visual tool and functional tool. The signal that a form is completed once the button is clicked and help guide the end user to turn in the data collected.

For this project I followed the instructions/guide on the class website. I always start top down. Since this is the 7th project, getting started is pretty standard with no surprises. I still have trouble getting images to work and have to tripple check my work to make sure I have linked the image correctly. Lastly, I found building the form to be tricky so I made sure to take my time and double check my work to the class website guide.
