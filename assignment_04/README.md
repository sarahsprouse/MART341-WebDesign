Browsers function as a software that allows access to the internet from different devices. They are designed differently depending on how they are written: html, CSS, or Java Script. I like using google chrome and safari because I have a mac.
Markup language is how we communicate with the web browser so we can define different elements within the page we are designing. Allowing different information to be distinguished and communicated. HTML is a common markup.
