1. My imaginary client was for a florist I follow on instagram. She is based in Canada and goes by the name Homebody. Her work focuses on bouquets and floral arrangements that include nature materials like mushrooms. She has a very earth tone that I wanted to carry in to this imaginary website.
2. Designing a website for the smallest screen your users will experience helps to ensure that your users' experience is seamless on any device. In today's digital world many users primarily experience websites on their phones too.
3. For this assignment I found it tricky to link each of the pages together. I could not remember how to make them link and kept getting stuck on one page without access to the others even though they were populated. I went back to the course website to go over navigation and checked my work to an older assignment from the semester that focused on multi page navigation. Cross checking helped me to spot my mistake and to properly link the pages.
