1. Div as an element lets us group other elements together - acting like a container. They can be single or nested. Classes is an attribute that is valid in every HTML element and is used as an identifier for HTML elements. Ids or Id attributes is a unique identifier for a specific element - it helps with organization and works with classes.
2. Using a service like Youtube or Soundcloud helps to make your video and music files more accessible. It allows you to easily share your media and provides some protection. The disadvantage is that in using these services your music becomes public and is easy to use in ways you might not have originally intended. That is why copyright information is important.
3. Embedding the video and audio file was tricky. I was typing the code rather than copying it from the generated embed code listed on the service site. Because I was typing it myself, I kept making tiny mistakes that were hard to spot. After typing out the video embed code I realized I could copy it from the service site and found my code to then work great.
