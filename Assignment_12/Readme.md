1. Padding allows you to change the space around a container so that the content can breathe and to determine how the content will be "read" by the viewer. It is the amount of space between the inner content of an element and the outer part of the element. Margin is the space between the element and other elements or the edge of the main element. A boarder is the space (height and width) around the content within the element. 
2. I found this assignment to be the most challenging so far. I was excited to try a split screen div, but could not figure out why my split screen was covering the entire page. It took me a long time to finally get the split div to display just at the top of the page instead of the entirety of the contents. I went over all of the css and html code multiple times and ended up playing with different adjustments till I saw a change. Once that happened I realized that I needed to set the border and padding. It was fun to problem solve and it was also very rewarding to finally get the code right.
