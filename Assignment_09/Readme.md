1. This is my first time learning about HTML. Everything is new and fun and challenging to learn. It feels like I am learning a new language and I find that exciting! I really like creating divs and styling. Learning how to embed images was difficult for me. I was surprised by how long it took me to learn how to correctly add images, but now it feels like second nature!
2. I am very excited to learn more about CSS and styling. Without it, it feels like my sites are hard to follow and chunky. I appreciate how styling allows for sites to be easier to read and for information to be more accessible because it is easier to distinguish.
3. I learned how to overcome embedding images and double check my work. It is so easy to forget a period or dash and not write the code correctly. I like having to go over my work to figure out why something is not working. It can be challenging but it is worth it! When you problem solve it is very empowering!
