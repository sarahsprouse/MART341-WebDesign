# Assignment 3
## Sarah Sprouse
- This week I learned the difference between IP and DNS. I previously did not know there was a difference and thought DNS was the same as an IP address.
- I really enjoyed learning about markdown. I have seen it before but did not know what each mark meant. It feels like I have learned a new language and I am very excited to *use* "What I have learned."
- I appreciated learning about the general flow of information on the web. The web has always been confusing to me it is nice to know the difference between the web and internet and how important each element of the web is for the functionality of the "internet." I found the difference between the infastructure and internet protocols to be really helpful! Breaking everything down has helped me to not feel as overwhelmed.
