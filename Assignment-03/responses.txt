The IP address is a unique location much like how DNS is a unique web name identifier. The IP address allows you to know more information about a device in the intricate network fo the web. DNS is often a host of information where the IP address is the source of information. Both are important identifiers when navigating the internet and to communicate.
- A cookie is a small text data file that is unique to the IP address of a device or server. Websites use cookies for their data purposes and to track behavior of a specific device.
- A URL is a uniform resource locator. Every website has a URL assigned to it. We use URLs to navigate the internet as they help to keep things organized and identifiable. URLs are broken down into protocol, domain, path, and file. As mentioned on our class website, a protocol is how the web browser communicates with a web server often identified as HTTP. The Domain or DNS is the unique identifier and direction for a siteâ€™s content. A path is the url instructions for how to navigate the directories.
