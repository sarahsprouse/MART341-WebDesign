          I am inspired by a lot of makers! Currently, my work is very inspired by poet Mary Oliver and dancer Marlee Grace.

<div class="third-paragraph">
Oh do you have time
  <br>
  to linger
    <br>
    for just a little while
      <br>
      out of your busy
<p> and very important day
  <br>
for the goldfinches
  <br>
that have gathered
  <br>
in a field of thistles </p>

for a musical battle,
  <br>
to see who can sing
  <br>
the highest note,
  <br>
or the lowest,
  <br>
    <br>

or the most expressive of mirth,
  <br>
or the most tender?
  <br>
Their strong, blunt beaks
  <br>
drink the air
  <br>
    <br>

as they strive
  <br>
melodiously
  <br>
not for your sake
  <br>
and not for mine
  <br>
    <br>

and not for the sake of winning
  <br>
but for sheer delight and gratitude â€“
  <br>
believe us, they say,
  <br>
it is a serious thing
  <br>
    <br>

just to be alive
  <br>
on this fresh morning
  <br>
in the broken world.
  <br>
I beg of you,
  <br>
    <br>

do not walk by
  <br>
without pausing
  <br>
to attend to this
  <br>
rather ridiculous performance.
  <br>
    <br>

It could mean something.
  <br>
It could mean everything.
  <br>
It could be what Rilke meant, when he wrote:
  <br>
You must change your life.
